Atmospheric dispersion models use mathematical equations to calculate pollution concentrations in the receiving environment; however, there can be variations in the accuracy of a pollutant's calculated concentration among different models due to the nature of the modeling environment and limitations on computational complexities. In this study two types of popular Gaussian pollution dispersion models, AERMOD and ADMS, were investigated to analyze their behavior under specific conditions. Initially, both models were simulated for point and line sources of emission.
