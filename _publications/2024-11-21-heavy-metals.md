This investigation aims to identify sources and assess the concentrations, spatial distribution patterns, and ecological and health risks of Zn, Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr, and Cd from road dust samples collected from Qom, Iran. Samples were collected from the surface of the roads, and were air-dried for 15 days. The study provides comprehensive analysis of heavy metal contamination in urban environments and its potential impacts on human and ecological health.
