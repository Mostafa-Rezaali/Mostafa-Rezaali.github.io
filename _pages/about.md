I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Geography at the University of Florida, specializing in climate and earth system sciences. My research focuses on understanding, detecting, and predicting heat waves and extreme weather events through the integration of numerical climate models with advanced machine learning techniques.

Research Focus
======
My work addresses critical challenges in climate science by developing data-driven approaches that enhance our capacity to forecast extreme weather events and support climate adaptation strategies. I am particularly interested in:

- Heat wave dynamics and thermodynamic drivers
- Extreme weather event mechanisms and predictability
- Climate variability and change across temporal scales
- Earth system feedbacks and teleconnections
- Integration of earth system models with machine learning methods

Methodological Approach
======
I employ a combination of traditional climate science methods and cutting-edge artificial intelligence to advance our understanding of climate extremes. My research leverages:

- Climate reanalysis datasets (ERA5, CMIP6, MERRA-2)
- Machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition and prediction
- Statistical analysis of climate extremes
- High-performance computing for large-scale climate data processing
- Spatiotemporal analysis of climate phenomena

Research Goals
======
Through my work, I aim to improve our ability to predict extreme weather events, particularly heat waves, which pose significant risks to human health, agriculture, and infrastructure. By bridging physical climate science with machine learning, I seek to advance both our fundamental understanding of climate extremes and their practical prediction at decision-relevant timescales.

I am committed to open science and reproducible research, and actively work to make climate data analysis methods accessible to the broader research community through open-source tools and documentation.
